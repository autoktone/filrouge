Example of architecture with micro services through an API gateway.
This a student project but it can be useful for other people who may need to connect a front with a back end using API Rest requests.
Docker is helpful here to deploy this basic python project (useful for ML tasks for example). Those services can be then deployed in Cloud Infrastructure (example AWS, Azure, Google Cloud...).
