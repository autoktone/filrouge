Example of SOA, Service Oriented Architecture with micro services through an API gateway.
This a student project but it can be useful for other people who may need to connect a front with a back end using API Rest requests.
Docker is helpful here to deploy this basic python/FastApi/Flask/joblib project (useful for ML tasks for example). Those services can be then deployed in Cloud Infrastructure as scalable containers with different public IP Addresses and Ports (example AWS, Azure, Google Cloud...).
This repository can be cloned through Azure CLI in order to deploy the project files into a virtual machine (Linux Ubuntu for example).
